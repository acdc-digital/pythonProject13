Installation and Local Deployment

1. Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed on your system.
2. Install the required packages:

pip install flask
pip install flask_sqlalchemy
pip install flask_bcrypt
pip install flask_login
pip install flask_sslify
pip install transformers
pip install torch
pip install scikit-learn
pip install nltk

3. Clone the project repository and navigate to the project folder:

git clone https://github.com/acdc-digital/smoladex.git
cd generated

4. Set up the database:

python database.py

5. Run the main.py file to train and evaluate the model, apply the privacy filter, and interpret medical data:

python main.py

***We’ve been having issues at this location. The latest error was, “FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'user_data’”. We’ve been experiencing some issues with the connections in this file. Please review each connection carefully, and make the appropriate revisions to correct these issues. Continue to debug the application, going through the application files extensively to search for errors. Ensure to double check your work as we’re nearing the completion of this project. Continue with instructions:

6. Run the app.py file to start the Flask application:

python app.py

7. Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the Medex application. Usage Once the application is running, users can upload their medical information and chat with the Medex assistant to understand their data better. Users can also choose which information to share with others, allowing them to chat against their data or comments without direct communication.

The Medex assistant uses a trained language model to interpret medical terms and abbreviations, providing users with a better understanding of their medical data. The application also implements a privacy filter to protect sensitive information.
Debugging and Improvements
As a junior developer, you should focus on understanding the code structure, functionality, and dependencies. To debug and improve the application, follow these steps:

1. Familiarize yourself with the Flask framework, SQLAlchemy, and the Transformers library.
2. Review the code in each file, understanding the purpose of each function and class.
3. Identify any potential issues or areas for improvement in the code, such as performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, or code readability.
4. Make the necessary changes to the code, ensuring that you maintain the existing functionality and adhere to best practices.
5. Test your changes thoroughly, ensuring that the application still functions correctly and that any improvements have the desired effect.
6. Document your changes and any issues you encountered during the debugging process.
7. Submit your updated code and documentation to the project lead for review and integration into the main project.
8. Provide additional context to the Readme file including a clear title, project label, summary, and other appropriate information that users may want to know when visiting the repo.

Given that you are encountering a FileNotFoundError, it's possible there might be an issue with the way you're specifying the location of 'user_data'. Here are a few things you might want to check:

File path: The error might be arising from an incorrect file path. Make sure that the 'user_data' file is located in the path that the code is expecting it to be.
File existence: Make sure the 'user_data' file or directory actually exists. If the 'user_data' is a directory, check if it's empty. Some functions fail when they're pointed at an empty directory.
File permissions: Check if the user running the script has the necessary permissions to read the file.
It would be helpful for your developer to trace back the error to the line of code that's causing the issue, which will provide some context on why the FileNotFoundError is happening.

In addition to the steps you have mentioned for debugging and improvements, it's also recommended to add steps for setting up a virtual environment for the project. This is considered a good practice as it can avoid version conflicts between packages required by different projects. Here's how you can include it:

Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:

bash
Copy code
env\Scripts\activate
On Unix or MacOS:

bash
Copy code
source env/bin/activate
Install required packages within the virtual environment:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: You should create a requirements.txt file with pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing all required packages)

Finally, as the application seems to be quite complex, it might be a good idea to setup a debugger such as pdb in Python or setup an integrated development environment that includes a debugging feature. This would allow your developer to step through their code, examine data, and understand what the code is actually doing to identify potential issues.
